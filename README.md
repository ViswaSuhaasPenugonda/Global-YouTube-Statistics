# Global-YouTube-Statistics

YouTube has become one of the most dominant platforms for video content and boasts over 2 billion monthly active users worldwide. This has created an ecosystem where creative individuals can potentially reach a massive audience and even monetize their channels into full-time businesses. However, despite its vast scale and impact, there has been little quantitative analysis done on the
platform itself - especially across different regional markets.
To fill this gap, this project aims to provide in-depth data-driven insights into YouTube's global landscape using a recently released dataset on the top 1,000 channels worldwide. By covering granular statistics like number of subscribers, total upload views, estimated earnings as well as geographic, category and channel type breakdowns, this dataset enables a multifaceted perspective into what content resonates best on YouTube and the dynamics behind a channel's success. Potential analyses include exploring the correlation between uploads and earnings, content preferences based on country demographics, analyzing breakout categories and more. These learnings can in turn be leveraged by existing and aspiring creators, media analysts as well as policy makers looking to support domestic talent. With online video projected to be a $335B industry by 2025, understanding the world's largest video platform is crucial. This project attempts to shed more light by deriving actionable, data-backed insights from the ground up based on real-world YouTube performance.
